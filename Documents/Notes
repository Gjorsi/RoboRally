First meeting:  introduction, start create a plan
Second meeting:  create a structure plan
Third meeting: 
ved små endringer: merge
ved store endringer: pull request, skrive på slack at man har sendt en pull request
Møter: første onsdag etter innlevering retrospektiv-møte og andre onsdag etter er status-møte. Kommunisere på slack, huske å assigne issues på git når vi jobber.
prosjektmetodikk: to til tre ukers sykeler avhengig av deadline, blanding av scrum og kanban. jobber med en ting av gangen.






Kanban
Scrum
Roles & Responsibilities
There are no pre-defined roles for a team. Although there may still be a Project Manager, the team is encouraged to collaborate and chip in when any one person becomes overwhelmed. X


Due Dates / Delivery Timelines


Deliverables are determined by sprints, or set periods of time in which a set of work must be completed and ready for review. X
Delegation & Prioritization
Uses a “pull system,” or a systematic workflow that allows team members to only “pull” new tasks once the previous task is complete. X


Modifications / Changes
Allows for changes to be made to a project mid-stream, allowing for iterations and continuous improvement prior to the completion of a project. X


Measurement of Productivity


Measures production using velocity through sprints. Each sprint is laid out back-to-back and/or concurrently so that each additional sprint relies on the success of the one before it. X
Best Applications


Best for teams with stable priorities that may not change as much over time. X
