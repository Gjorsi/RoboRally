# ManualTesting

## GUI
- Run [main](src/main/java/sky7/main/Main.java)
- Clicking on a card should move it from hand to registry,
unless you already have 5 cards in the registry
- Pressing the *RESET* button should return the chosen cards to the hand
- After picking 5 cards the *GO* button should appear
- Pressing *GO* makes the robot move depending on which cards you choose

## During game
- Check that if the robot tries to move outside the board it stops
and does not go outside the board
